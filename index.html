<p>This summer I will be riding from Land's End to John O'Groats. The route will be along some of the National Cycle Network, resulting in a total distance of a whisker over 1000 miles.</p>

<p>As well as being a personal challenge and dream of mine, the ride is in aid of raising money for Sustrans.</p>

<h3>Sustrans</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.sustrans.org.uk/">Sustrans</a> is a charity with a vision that by 2020, 4 out of 5 local journeys be made by bike, foot or public transport. They are the charity behind the <a href="http://www.sustrans.org.uk/ncn/map/national-cycle-network/about-network">National Cycle Network</a>: a network of over 14000 miles, much off the road on safe, traffic free paths. Despite its name, the Network isn't just for cyclists, it’s also popular with walkers, joggers, wheelchair users and horse riders too. The network passes within a mile of over half of all UK homes, providing safe, healthy travel and leisure options for millions.</p>

<p>On a personal note, Sustrans <a href="http://www.sustrans.org.uk/policy-evidence/the-impact-of-our-work/great-new-canal-towpath-walking-and-cycling-sale-and">refurbished the Bridgewater Canal</a> from Sale to Stretford: a route which will allows my daughter to cycle safely to primary school and forms the majority of my commute to work.</p>

<p>The National Cycle Network has suffered significant damage from the floods around Christmas so needs our help more than ever.</p>

<h3>Goal</h3>

<p>My aim is to help raise <em>£1000</em> - approximately £1 per mile. Please donate as little or as much as you are able. For every £10 donated with GiftAid, £12.15 will go to Sustrans.</p>

<h3>Please donate if you can</h3>
