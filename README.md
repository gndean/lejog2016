# lejog2016

A cycle ride fundraiser page with animated Google Map of route to display total raised so far as progress along the route. The donation total and most recent donor name is extracted from the JustGiving API.

Created for a Land's End to John O'Groats (LEJOG) charity ride. Hosted here in case it's useful for anyone else to use.

Currently hosted at [pedalthe.bike](https://pedalthe.bike)

## Limitations

* The cyclist animation currently only differentiates between directions: north, north east and east
* Only supports JustGiving API, no other fundraiser sites

## Notes

* The cycling animation maker is based on one at http://www.heathersanimations.com/bicycles.html and is stated to be free to use but the original source is not known.

## How to customise

* Edit the index.html file for your own story. Don't forget to link to _your_ fundraiser site.
* Edit the javascripts/config.js file with the details of your route.
* Host as you wish. I used pages.github.com and a custom domain
